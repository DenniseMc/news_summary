# News Search Application

This application allows users to search for the latest news articles based on a query (e.g., "Pok√©mon") using the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/). The user enters a query, and the app displays the top 3 articles, including their title, image (or a placeholder), summary, and a link to read the full article.

## Features

- **View Top 3 Articles**: Displays the 3 most recent articles along with their images (or a placeholder if no image is available), summaries, and links.
- **Responsive Interface**: Clean and simple UI with a search input, button, and results area. All components are styled for easy use.

## Prerequisites

- Required Python packages:
  - `requests`: For making HTTP requests to fetch articles from the NewsAPI.
